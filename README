Welcome to MageLinker BETA.

MageLinker will symlink your Magento module into any Magento installation
making it easier and faster for you to manage development of your modules.

1. Drop the magelinker.php file into your Magento root
2. Access it in the browser (eg. mystore.dev/magelinker.php)
3. Enter the module path you wish to link into your dev environment!

Currently compatible with Windows dev environments.

Support for Mac and Linux are on the way.
